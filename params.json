{"name":"The Alphabet","tagline":"I for one welcome our new Alphabet overlords","body":"After [the announcement](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/10/google_alphabet/) that Google is now one of many corporations housed under the wing of the newly-created [Alphabet corporation](http://abc.xyz), I reached out to some of my friends to help out compile a useful list of possible company names to fill out this new alphabet. After all, you can't really have an alphabet with only one letter (*technically you can, but it would make for a very boring language ~~ ed.*)\r\n\r\nWe hope this list will be useful to Page and Brin in their quest to make cool things!\r\n\r\n* **Aperture Science**.\r\nAlso Abstergo Industries or Alchemax\r\n* **Buy n Large**.\r\nBlue Sun is also a fine name, or even BiffCo Enterprises\r\n* **Cyberdyne Systems**.\r\nMaybe Cobra or Cloverleaf Industries?\r\n* **Dharma Initiative**\r\n* **EvilCorp**\r\n* **Fontaine Futuristics**\r\n* **Hyperion Corp.**\r\n* **InGen**.\r\nCan never go wrong with IniTech, if you're going for that business-y feel.\r\n* **J Corp**\r\n* **KAOS**\r\n* **LexCorp**.\r\nLos Pollos Hermanos if you prefer something more brotherly.\r\n* **M.A.D.**. \r\nA bunch of great options for M: M.A.R.S. Industries, MomCorp, or Multi-National United, all of which really encompass future and unity.\r\n* **New Path**\r\n* **OCP**\r\n* **Primatech**\r\n* **Quantum**\r\n* **Roxxon**.\r\nRekall is a great option too, more tech-oriented.\r\n* **SPECTRE**.\r\nSoylent would have been the preferred choice, but it's already taken. Shinra could appeal to the Asian markets.\r\n* **Tyrell Corporation**.\r\nWe hope to see some good cybernetic organisms out of T!\r\n* **Umbrella Corp.**\r\n* **Value-Tec**.\r\nVersalife or Virtucon would also work here.\r\n* **Weyland-Yutani**\r\n* **Xanatos Enterprises**\r\n* **Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems**\r\n* **Zorg Industries**\r\n\r\n*~~ lobsters et al*","google":"UA-3615334-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
